Customizable Random Sentence Generator in DOTNET / C#

Dual-purpose app, letting you:

1.) Create few to thousands of random sentences in the verb/noun/preposition/other structure desired.

2.) Assemble a few sentences that are ranked by their listed number of Google search results.

Suggested usages: poetry, inspiration, comedy, invention ideas, poor and confusing English.

To use appropriately:
Being a C# app, Visual Studio is required to run this after you download it/clone it. On it you will have to install Puppeteer Sharp to the project.
To install Puppeteer Sharp to the app: Once you have the project open in Visual Studio, click "Project" from the top select bar. In the window that opens, click the search bar and type "Puppeteer Sharp". The Window should populate with results, for mine it's the first result coming up as "Puppeteer Sharp". Click the select box. Once the select box is checked, click "Add Package".

Warnings: 

1.)Searching Google repetitively more than 5-10 times every go will likely cause your machine to be hit with CAPTCHA and lose that side of this app's functionality for a while, so don't go crazy with the 30+ searches.

2.) There is a known issue/bug on the Google searching side of things, where if there are no search results the process gives up and returns nothing for all the searches. 

3.) The app is intended to be a jumpingboard into whatever words can be put together. Their is no conjugation of verbs, no checking to ensure grammatical correctness whatsoever. Matter of fact the goal would be stymied by the enforcing of coherence. There is no ethical checking, and this app does not pretend to be a fortune teller or anything other than a sideffect of my learning C#. 

$Hello Microsoft!

As my rando-sentence generator likes to say: "The engineer that emphasizes brandishs clubs!"
